# Facebook-Marketplace-Redesign
UX/UI redesign project to improve Facebook Marketplace

## Project Idea

The project is a UX/UI redesign of Facebook Marketplace.
The main goal is to:
 • Improve the user experience when browsing and purchasing products
 • Increase trust between buyers and sellers
 • Reduce fraud and scams on the platform

 ## Problem

Facebook Marketplace is widely used, but it has real issues:
 • Limited product information: only the name and price are shown, no details about the seller or ratings
 • Unorganized interface: products are displayed randomly, making browsing difficult
 • Lack of trust and security elements: users cannot easily see if a seller is reliable or report fraudulent sellers
 • Weak search and filtering tools: the search bar is small and filtering options are limited

As a result, users are at risk of scams or purchasing products without enough information, leading to a poor experience.

## Project Goal
 • Provide a clear and organized product layout
 • Display complete information about the product and seller
 • Make searching and filtering easier
 • Add trust and security elements such as a Report button or seller ratings
 • Improve the overall user experience, making browsing and purchasing simple and safe

## Project Steps
 1. Analyze the current platform: study Facebook Marketplace’s interface and how it affects user experience
 2. Collect feedback and observations: study real scam cases to identify risk points
 3. Define solutions: propose improvements for product display, search, filters, and trust elements

## After Redesign 
 • A more organized and user-friendly platform
 • Complete product and seller information
 • Better search and filtering tools
 • Trust and security features to help users make safe decisions
 • Overall, a significantly improved user experience that reduces the chance of fraud
